# Todo_List_Of_Stuff_You_Will_Never_Do
My HTML/CSS + JS project : a todo-list using a FrotendMentor.io design with some features : completed task filter, dark/light mode, drag and drop,...

# Conclusion

- I haven't done the drag and drop stuff yet, the point is I don't like how I named my html elements and would like you fix all of them after having read stuff about html naming good practices

- I learnt at lot about DOM manipulation, I still really like how intuitive it is and would like to go further

- I now feel comfortable with CSS, however I don't like the way I organize the styles even if I commented some sections to regroup the styles, I think this is mainly because of html element names that are not clear enough and homogeneous

# Next stuff

- I'd like to do a more original project, get away from FrontendMentor designs and try to be creative, do a small and funny front-end app that I'll be able to host on GitHub pages and send to my friends, then I'll try to do something similar in TypeScript
